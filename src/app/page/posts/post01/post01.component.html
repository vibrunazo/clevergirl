  I'll analyse some match ups in the game using Game Theory. Some match ups can be very complex with several different permutations.
  But I'll start with a very simple one. The Velociraptor vs Allosaurus match up is fairly straight forward.
  So it's a nice example to practice some of the concepts of Game Theory.

<div class="versusbox">
  <app-portrait name="Allosaurus" rarity="0"></app-portrait>
  <span>X</span>
  <app-portrait name="Velociraptor" rarity="0"></app-portrait>
